5. Create a Ruby class triangle with initalizer, accessors, and member 
functions for computing the perimeter and the area of arbitrary triangles. 
Make also a member function test that checks sides a, b, and c and classifies 
the triangle as (1) equilateral, (2) isosceles, (3) scalene, (4) right, 
and (5) not a triangle. Right triangle can be either isosceles or scalene. 
Compute the perimeter and area only for valid triangles (verified by test). 
Show examples of the use of this class.
